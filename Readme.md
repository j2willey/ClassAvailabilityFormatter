# Class Availability Formatter
## Author: Jim Willey

This is a simple utility intended to digest a
   "Class Attendee Counts"  report from BlackPug
and provide printable user friendly summary of
Classes grouped by Block and sorted by available seats.

The raw report exported from Black Pug as a xls or csv
is overly verbose and by sorts all classes alphabetically
by class name.  It requires Camp staff to delete
superflous rows and columns to narrow down to relevant
information.  Then still needs to be sorted by Block.
And that is where staff have often left the data.
This utility takes it a step further sorting classes
based on open seats, and bolding classes that have
openings.
